<h1>Welcome to Redis!</h1>
Redis is a very fast non-relational database that stores a mapping of keys to five different types of values. Redis supports in-memory persistent storage on disk, replication to scale read performance, and client-side sharding1 to scale write performance.
Redis is considered fast for three reasons - <br>
a. All data is stored in memory <br>
b. Data is organised in simple data structures <br>
c. Redis has a simple feature set
